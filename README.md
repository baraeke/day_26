Day 26 - List Comprehension, Dictionary Comprehension, and the NATO Alphabet Project

Overview

Day 26 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp focuses on enhancing Python skills using list comprehension, dictionary comprehension, and iterating over Pandas DataFrames. The day concludes with the NATO Alphabet Project, which applies these concepts in a practical way.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this day, you will:

Understand and apply list comprehension to create and manipulate lists efficiently.

Use dictionary comprehension to build and modify dictionaries dynamically.

Iterate over a Pandas DataFrame to extract and manipulate data.

Complete the NATO Alphabet Project to reinforce the concepts learned.

Topics Covered

1. List Comprehension

Creating lists using list comprehension.

Squaring numbers using list comprehension.

Filtering even numbers using list comprehension.

Comparing two datasets using list comprehension.

2. Dictionary Comprehension

Creating dictionaries with dictionary comprehension.

Transforming and filtering dictionary data.

3. Iterating Over a Pandas DataFrame

Accessing rows and values efficiently.

Applying dictionary comprehension to DataFrame operations.

4. NATO Alphabet Project

Loading a CSV file containing the NATO phonetic alphabet.

Converting user-input words into NATO phonetic codes using dictionary comprehension.

Practicing error handling for invalid inputs.


Coding Exercises

Squaring Numbers: Transform a list of numbers into their squares using list comprehension.

Filtering Even Numbers: Extract only the even numbers from a list using list comprehension.

Data Overlap: Compare two datasets and find common elements using list comprehension.

Dictionary Comprehension 1: Modify dictionary values dynamically using comprehension.

Dictionary Comprehension 2: Filter a dictionary based on conditions.

Final Project: NATO Alphabet Converter

A program that converts words into NATO phonetic alphabet format.

Example:

Input: "hello"
Output: ['Hotel', 'Echo', 'Lima', 'Lima', 'Oscar']

Summary

This day strengthens Python comprehension techniques through practical applications, culminating in a real-world project. Mastering these concepts will significantly improve your efficiency in handling lists, dictionaries, and DataFrames.
